# Task 1: Data Cleaning and Metric Calculation

## 1. Data Cleaning

The first step in this task was to clean the provided market data to ensure it was suitable for analysis. The goal was to create a clean dataset that could be used for any kind of analytics without requiring further manipulation. The steps involved in cleaning the data were:

- **Column Renaming**: The original columns in the dataset were renamed to more meaningful and descriptive names such as `Date`, `Exchange`, `Market_Type`, `Trading_Pair`, and `Volume`.
- **Data Type Conversion**: The `Date` column was converted to a proper datetime format, and the `Volume` column was converted to numeric values to ensure accurate calculations.
- **Handling Missing Data**: Rows with missing values in critical columns (`Date`, `Exchange`, `Market_Type`, `Trading_Pair`, and `Volume`) were removed. Additionally, any rows with non-positive values in the `Volume` column were excluded, as these would skew the analysis.

After these steps, the data was ready for the calculation of the required metrics.

## 2. Metric Calculation

Based on the cleaned data, the following key metrics were calculated:

### a. Market Share

- **Definition**: Market Share is the percentage of Bitstamp's trading volume out of the total market volume.
- **Calculation**:
  - **Total Market Volume**: The sum of all trading volumes across all exchanges in the dataset.
  - **Bitstamp Volume**: The sum of trading volumes specifically on the Bitstamp exchange.
  - **Formula**: `Market Share = (Bitstamp Volume / Total Market Volume) * 100`

- **Result**: Bitstamp's volume accounts for approximately **0.0061%** of the total market volume.

### b. Addressable Market Share

- **Definition**: Addressable Market Share is the percentage of Bitstamp's trading volume out of the total market volume on trading pairs that are available for trading on Bitstamp.
- **Calculation**:
  - **Bitstamp Trading Pairs**: Identify all unique trading pairs available on Bitstamp.
  - **Addressable Market Volume**: The sum of trading volumes for these identified pairs across all exchanges.
  - **Formula**: `Addressable Market Share = (Bitstamp Volume / Addressable Market Volume) * 100`

- **Result**: Initially calculated as **0.0061%**. 

- **Potential Issue**: If the addressable market share is the same as the overall market share, it may indicate that the trading pairs on Bitstamp are not unique to Bitstamp and are traded similarly on other exchanges, or there was an error in calculating the addressable market volume. This metric should typically be higher than the overall market share since it only considers pairs where Bitstamp is actively trading.

### c. Market Coverage

- **Definition**: Market Coverage is the percentage of the total market volume that is generated on base assets supported by Bitstamp.
- **Calculation**:
  - **Bitstamp Base Assets**: Identify the base currencies (e.g., BTC, ETH) for all trading pairs on Bitstamp.
  - **Market Coverage Volume**: The sum of trading volumes for all trading pairs across all exchanges where the base currency is supported by Bitstamp.
  - **Formula**: `Market Coverage = (Market Coverage Volume / Total Market Volume) * 100`

- **Result**: **99.42%** of the total market volume is generated on base assets that Bitstamp supports.

## 3. Competitor Analysis

### Identifying Direct Competitors

- **Focus**: The analysis focuses on exchanges with a similar business model and target audience as Bitstamp. These would be exchanges that primarily offer spot trading and cater to a similar user base.
- **Identified Competitors**: Based on the volume data, the direct competitors of Bitstamp include:
  - **Binance**
  - **Coinbase**
  - **Kraken**
  - **Kucoin**
  - **Deribit**

### Volume Structure Comparison

- **Analysis**: A comparison of the volume distribution across different trading pairs between Bitstamp and its identified competitors.
- **Observations**:
  - **Diverse Offerings**: Competitors like Binance have a highly diversified set of trading pairs, which might contribute to their larger market share.
  - **Market Focus**: Bitstamp's focus on certain base assets may result in a higher market coverage but a lower overall market share due to less diversity in trading pairs.
  - **Volume Concentration**: The concentration of trading volume in specific pairs can indicate where Bitstamp is most competitive or where it may need to expand its offerings to gain a larger market share.

### Final Insights

- **Addressable Market Share Issue**: The addressable market share being identical to the overall market share suggests that Bitstamp's influence is proportionate across its trading pairs. This might require further investigation into whether Bitstampâ€™s offerings are unique or if the calculation needs adjustment to accurately reflect the targeted market.
