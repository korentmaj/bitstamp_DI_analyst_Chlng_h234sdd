# Task 1: Data Cleaning and Metric Calculation

## 1. Data Cleaning

The first step in this task was to clean the provided market data to ensure it was suitable for analysis. The goal was to create a clean dataset that could be used for any kind of analytics without requiring further manipulation. The steps involved in cleaning the data were:

- **Column Renaming**: The original columns in the dataset were renamed to more meaningful and descriptive names such as `Date`, `Exchange`, `Market_Type`, `Trading_Pair`, and `Volume`.
- **Data Type Conversion**: The `Date` column was converted to a proper datetime format, and the `Volume` column was converted to numeric values to ensure accurate calculations.
- **Handling Missing Data**: Rows with missing values in critical columns (`Date`, `Exchange`, `Market_Type`, `Trading_Pair`, and `Volume`) were removed. Additionally, any rows with non-positive values in the `Volume` column were excluded, as these would skew the analysis.

After these steps, the data was ready for the calculation of the required metrics.

## 2. Metric Calculation

Based on the cleaned data, the following key metrics were calculated:

### a. Market Share

- **Definition**: Market Share is the percentage of Bitstamp's trading volume out of the total market volume.
- **Calculation**:
  - **Total Market Volume**: The sum of all trading volumes across all exchanges in the dataset.
  - **Bitstamp Volume**: The sum of trading volumes specifically on the Bitstamp exchange.
  - **Formula**: `Market Share = (Bitstamp Volume / Total Market Volume) * 100`

- **Result**: Bitstamp's volume accounts for approximately **0.0061%** of the total market volume.

### c. Market Coverage

- **Definition**: Market Coverage is the percentage of the total market volume that is generated on base assets supported by Bitstamp.
- **Calculation**:
  - **Bitstamp Base Assets**: Identify the base currencies (e.g., BTC, ETH) for all trading pairs on Bitstamp.
  - **Market Coverage Volume**: The sum of trading volumes for all trading pairs across all exchanges where the base currency is supported by Bitstamp.
  - **Formula**: `Market Coverage = (Market Coverage Volume / Total Market Volume) * 100`

- **Result**: **99.42%** of the total market volume is generated on base assets that Bitstamp supports.

## 3. Competitor Analysis

### Identifying Direct Competitors

- **Focus**: The analysis focuses on exchanges with a similar business model and target audience as Bitstamp. These would be exchanges that primarily offer spot trading and cater to a similar user base.
- **Identified Competitors**: Based on the volume data, the direct competitors of Bitstamp include:
  - **Binance**
  - **Coinbase**
  - **Kraken**
  - **Kucoin**
  - **Deribit**

### Volume Structure Comparison

- **Analysis**: A comparison of the volume distribution across different trading pairs between Bitstamp and its identified competitors.
- **Observations**:
  - **Diverse Offerings**: Competitors like Binance have a highly diversified set of trading pairs, which might contribute to their larger market share.
  - **Market Focus**: Bitstamp's focus on certain base assets may result in a higher market coverage but a lower overall market share due to less diversity in trading pairs.
  - **Volume Concentration**: The concentration of trading volume in specific pairs can indicate where Bitstamp is most competitive or where it may need to expand its offerings to gain a larger market share.
